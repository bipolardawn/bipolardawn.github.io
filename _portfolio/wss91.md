*Welcome to the 90’s, kid! It’s the end of the 20th century, and you can now experience videogames like never before on the new 16-bit generation!*<br>
*World Soccer Strikers ’91 is a physics-based, retro-style “soccer” game, featuring 1-to-8 player arcade goodness with no magnetic feet! – This means the ball is completely independent from your player. You’ll have to aim, dribble and shoot all by yourself!*
